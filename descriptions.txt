Insertion Sort:
  Insertion sort is often described similarly to how playing cards are commonly sorted in your hands. The array/list of numbers being sorted is separated into a sorted and an unsorted part. As the values of the array are iterated through, the values that are still in the unsorted part of the array will be placed in their correct positions in the sorted part of the array. 

When sorting an array of size n:
1. Beginning at the first index of the array, compare this element to the next element in the array (n, n will change as it iterates).
2. Compare the element at index n to the element directly before it.
3. If the element at index n is less than the element directly before it, continue to compare it to the elements before that one, until it is no longer smaller than the element it is being compared to.
4. Move up the elements that were greater than the element at index n to make space for the element that was swapped.
